## GitHub projects for Aren Boulet

I am a passionate researcher with an M.Sc. in Biochemistry, and over ten years’ experience in academic and industry research facilities. 

From an early age, I've always loved solving puzzles. Science became the perfect outlet for that curiousity. I've since worked on developing clinical diagnostic tests, mapping protein-protein interaction changes in metabolic diseases, and characterizing mouse models of human genetic diseases. This work has led to international recognition and publications.

I am currently responsible the designing and carrying-out a wide range of sequencing projects. This includes advising on the overall approach, carrying out the bench-work, and running/maintaining the sequencing equipment itself.
